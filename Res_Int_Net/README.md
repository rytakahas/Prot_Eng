# Residue Interaction Network (RIN) Analysis

This project builds **Residue Interaction Networks (RINs)** from protein structures, incorporating ligands and cofactors as weighted nodes based on the number of hydrogen bonds.

The pipeline can accept:
- **Experimental structures** (PDB IDs)
- **Predicted models** (e.g., AlphaFold2, ESMFold)

---

## Project Overview

- Parse protein 3D structures.
- Construct a graph where nodes = residues/ligands, edges = interactions.
- Ligand and cofactor connections are weighted by the number of hydrogen bonds.
- Calculate centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness) for each node.
- Analyze redidue and ligands/cofactors and protein-protein intreactions on the structural network.

## What This Module Does

This module:

- Parses protein structures (PDB or mmCIF)
- Builds a **residue interaction graph** (based on distance thresholds or contact rules)
- Computes **graph centrality metrics** such as:
  - Degree centrality
  - Betweenness centrality
  - Eigenvector centrality
- Can be extended to support ML-based classification or ranking of residues

### Endpoint

```http
POST /residue_graph_analysis
Example Request (sample_input.json)

{
  "structure_path": "/path/to/protein_structure.pdb"
}
```

Input
structure_path: Full path to a PDB or mmCIF structure file

Supported sources:

RCSB PDB

AlphaFold DB (AF3)

Your own predicted models (e.g., RoseTTAFold, ESMFold)

## Currently supports local file paths only. File upload support is planned.

Response

    {"residue": "TYR123", "betweenness": 0.91, "eigenvector": 0.63},
    ...
  ]
}
```

### File: residue_network.py
This module performs:

Parsing of .pdb or .mmcif structure files

Construction of a residue-level interaction graph (e.g., via distance-based edges)

Computation of standard graph centralities per residue

Optional export to JSON or integration into ML pipelines

Function Template

```python
# residue_network.py

def build_residue_graph(structure_path):
    """
    Parses a PDB or mmCIF file and builds a residue interaction graph.
    Returns a networkx.Graph object.
    """
    pass

def compute_centralities(G):
    """
    Computes centrality metrics (e.g., degree, betweenness, eigenvector).

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5050/analyze_structure \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample_request.json
```
Input: JSON containing either:

A PDB ID (download automatically).

A file path to a local structure (PDB/mmCIF format).

Output: RIN graph metrics and centrality scores.

### TODO List

- Build RIN graph dynamically with ligand interactions.
- Return JSON with centrality results and graph summaries.
- Dockerize for easy deployment.
- R&D: Protein Allosteric Memory Condition

  This repository explores the **memory condition** introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 028101 (2022)]  (https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.028101) and how it can be **applied across modeling paradigms** â€” from classical   normal mode analysis (ANM) to statistical mechanics (MD) and quantum mechanics (QM/MM).

---

#####  Memory Condition

  The core condition for **retention of signal or memory** along an edge (i.e., between two interacting elements such as atoms, residues, or sites) is:

  $\[
  \left\langle \frac{q_{ij}^2}{\kappa_{ij}} \right\rangle > \gamma
  \]$

  where:

  - $\( q_{ij} \)$: response to perturbation between nodes $\(i\)$ and $\(j\)$
  - $\( \kappa_{ij} \)$: stiffness or resistance of the interaction
  - $\( \gamma \)$: memory threshold

  If this condition is satisfied, the edge is considered to have **retained memory** of the perturbation.

  ---

##### Model-Agnostic Interpretation

  The condition is **model-agnostic**, and the terms can be redefined according to the physical layer:

| Modeling Domain         | \( q_{ij} \): Response                   | \( \kappa_{ij} \): Resistance/Stiffness       | Notes |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Normal Mode Analysis (ANM)** | Relative displacement in a mode      | Spring constant (usually 1.0)                  | Classical elastic model |
| **Perturbation Response Scanning (PRS)** | Displacement due to force at node | Local mechanical resistance (can be Hessian)   | Linear force propagation |
| **Molecular Dynamics (MD)**   | Time-averaged distance fluctuation   | Effective stiffness (from fluctuations)        | Requires long simulations |
| **QM / QM-MM**                | Change in charge, bond length, or dipole | Force constant from PES, Hessian matrix        | Sensitive to electronic structure |

---

##### Application Scenarios

  - Identify **signal-retaining edges** or **residue-residue pathways**
  - Predict **allosteric hotspots** or **communication networks**
  - Combine with **centrality analysis** (e.g., edge betweenness) for robust signal path detection

---

##### ðŸ§ª Examples (Coming Soon)

  - `prody_memory_condition.py`: Apply the condition using ANM from ProDy
  - `qm_memory_evaluator.py`: Parse Hessian output from Gaussian/ORCA to evaluate memory condition at binding sites
  - `networkx_memory_paths.ipynb`: Visualize predicted allosteric pathways with centrality overlays

Notes
Ligand weights enrich the standard RIN approach by capturing chemical environment effects.

This approach is suitable for small molecule docking evaluations, druggability assessments, and protein design tasks.
