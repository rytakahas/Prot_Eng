# Res_Int_Net: Residue Interaction Network Analysis

This project builds **Residue Interaction Networks (RINs)** from protein structures, incorporating **ligands** and **cofactors** as weighted nodes based on the number of hydrogen bonds.

The pipeline can accept:
- **Experimental structures** (PDB IDs)
- **Predicted models** (e.g., AlphaFold2, ESMFold)

---

## Project Overview

- Parse protein 3D structures.
- Construct a graph where nodes = residues/ligands, edges = interactions.
- Ligand and cofactor connections are **weighted** by the number of **hydrogen bonds**.
- Calculate **centrality measures** (degree, closeness, betweenness) for each node.
- Analyze the impact of ligands/cofactors on the structural network.

## Planned API (Coming Soon)

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5050/analyze_structure \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample_request.json
```
Input: JSON containing either:

A PDB ID (download automatically).

A file path to a local structure (PDB/mmCIF format).

Output: RIN graph metrics and centrality scores.

### TODO List
- Implement Flask API server.
- Accept either PDB ID or uploaded structure file.
- Build RIN graph dynamically with ligand interactions.
- Return JSON with centrality results and graph summaries.
- Dockerize for easy deployment.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Biopython
- NetworkX
- RDKit (optional, for more advanced ligand handling)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for plotting)

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notes
Ligand weights enrich the standard RIN approach by capturing chemical environment effects.

This approach is suitable for small molecule docking evaluations, druggability assessments, and protein design tasks.
