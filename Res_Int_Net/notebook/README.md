#  Residue Interaction Network Construction Notebook

---

##  Notebook Overview

| Step | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| 1 | **Load a 3D structure** (PDB, mmCIF, or AlphaFold2 predicted) |
| 2 | **Parse residues** and **ligand atoms** |
| 3 | **Build interaction graph** where: |
|    | - Nodes = Residues or ligands |
|    | - Edges = Interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, contacts) |
| 4 | **Weight ligand connections** by number of hydrogen bonds |
| 5 | **Calculate centralities**: degree, closeness, betweenness |
| 6 | **Visualize or export** the RIN for further analysis |

---

## Key Techniques

- **Hydrogen bond detection** between residues and ligands.
- **Graph-based representation** of 3D protein structures.
- **Network centrality analysis** to identify key residues and ligand impacts.

---

## Example Use Cases

- Identifying **allosteric hotspots**.
- Studying **ligand-mediated interactions**.
- Mapping **critical residues** for function or stability.
- Investigating **cofactor influence** on protein networks.

# Notes

- Structures can be downloaded automatically from the **Protein Data Bank** via PDB IDs.
- Structures predicted by **AlphaFold2** or other tools can also be processed seamlessly.
- Ligands and cofactors greatly modify local network topology; their inclusion is crucial.
