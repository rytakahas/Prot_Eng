### Fine-Tuning for Protein Sequence Prediction:
Main workflow:
  1. Get MSA for your wild-type/target protein.

  2. Calculate sequence weights using e.g. Henikoff or Meff methods.

  3. Feed MSA sequences (with weights) to pretrain/fine-tune ProtBert (if using custom loss or attention).

  4. Extract embeddings for all mutants (WT + experimental) using ProtBert.

  5. Supervised regression/classification: Only use experimental mutants + measured property (activity, etc.) to fit a downstream model (e.g. MLP, XGBoost) on top of these embeddings.

  Causion: Avoid leakage - Never train or validate on the same sequences used in initial unsupervised steps.

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Model | UniRep (pretrained on UniRef50 dataset) |
| Architecture | LSTM |
| License | **Academic-only** |
| Fine-tuning method | Full fine-tuning |
| Input sequences | Evolutionary sequences gathered using BLAST searches |
| Output | Fine-tuned model for mutation activity prediction |

**UniRep** is used here primarily as a **baseline benchmark** for protein sequence mutation prediction.

#### `protBert_ACT.ipynb`

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Model | ProtBERT (pretrained on BFD dataset) |
| Architecture | Transformer (BERT) |
| License | Commercial use allowed |
| Fine-tuning method | Full fine-tuning |
| Input sequences | Evolutionary sequences obtained via BLAST |
| Output | Fine-tuned ProtBERT model capable of scoring mutant proteins |

 **ProtBERT** is modern, flexible, and optimized for production and commercial applications.

#### Fine-Tuning Details (Both Notebooks)

- Evolutionary sequences are mined via **BLAST+**.
- Sequences are vectorized and fine-tuned fully.
- Mixed precision (`torch.amp.autocast`) is used for memory efficiency.
- 1 epoch, small batch size to fit Colab T4 GPUs (~16GB VRAM).

---

#### Notes

- UniRep and ProtBERT have different licensing terms â€” make sure you understand which one to deploy based on your use case.
- Both models were designed to be production-ready in a future API server.
