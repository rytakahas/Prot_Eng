# ðŸ§¬ Protein Mutation Prediction Platform

Fine-tuning pretrained protein sequence models on evolutionary information for mutation activity prediction.

---

## Project Overview

Main workflow:
  1. Get MSA for your wild-type/target protein.

  2. Calculate sequence weights using e.g. Henikoff or Meff methods.

  3. Feed MSA sequences (with weights) to pretrain/fine-tune ProtBert (if using custom loss or attention).

  4. Extract embeddings for all mutants (WT + experimental) using ProtBert.

  5. Supervised regression/classification: Only use experimental mutants + measured property (activity, etc.) to fit a downstream model (e.g. MLP, XGBoost) on top of these embeddings.

  Causion: Avoid leakage - Never train or validate on the same sequences used in initial unsupervised steps.

DL, LLM models:

- **UniRep** (LSTM, UniRef50 pretrained) â€“ research-only.
- **ProtBERT** (Transformer, BFD pretrained) â€“ commercially allowed.

Both workflows enable full fine-tuning thanks to their manageable model size and flexible architecture.
However, LoRA/QLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation/Quantized LoRA) can be deployed.

## Planned + Implemented API (Flask)

Iâ€™ve implemented a minimal REST API using Flask for inference.

### Current Usage (Single-File API)

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5050/mutation_prediction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample_input.json
```

Sample Input (sample_input.json)
```json
{
  "wild_type_sequence": "MKTIIALSYIFCLVFADYKDDDDK",
  "mutation_csv_base64": null
}
```

The API will return:

New mutant predictions

Fitness/activity scores

Metadata (CSV row count if provided)

### TODO List
- Build Flask-based API (prot_api_flask/)
- Add /mutation_prediction POST endpoint
- Implement Dockerfile for deployment
- Enable batch sequence input
- Add automated testing for API endpoints
- Add GPU-compatible ProtBERT loading via Hugging Face
