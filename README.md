# 🧬 Prot_Eng: Protein Engineering Toolkit

**Prot_Eng** provides tools for protein structure and sequence-based analysis, supporting mutation effect prediction and residue interaction network exploration.

---

## Current Modules

### 1. Res_Int_Net
- **Residue Interaction Networks** (RINs) built from protein structures (PDB/AF2).
- Ligand and cofactor interactions are **weighted** by the number of **hydrogen bonds**.
- **Centrality metrics** (degree, closeness, betweenness) are calculated.
- Currently available as a **Jupyter Notebook**.
- API release planned soon!

### 2. Seq_MLs
- **Sequence-based Machine Learning models** for predicting mutation impacts.
- Fine-tuning of pretrained models like **UniRep** and **ProtBERT** on evolutionary sequence data.
- Currently available as **Jupyter Notebooks**.
- API release planned soon!

## Upcoming Developments

-  **API for Res_Int_Net**:
  - Input: PDB ID or structure file.
  - Output: RIN graph with centrality scores.

-  **API for Seq_MLs**:
  - Input: Protein sequence or mutant variants.
  - Output: Predicted activity or fitness scores.

-  **Combined API** (Future):
  - Jointly analyze sequence mutations **and** structure networks.
  - Enable holistic mutation effect prediction considering both sequence and 3D structural contexts.
